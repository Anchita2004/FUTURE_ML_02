# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Task 2

This project was completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Future Interns**. It focuses on building an end-to-end ML system to **predict customer churn** using classification models and deploying the solution with an interactive dashboard.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal is to identify customers likely to leave a service (churn) based on features like balance, credit score, contract type, and more.

### 🔧 Key Steps:
- Feature engineering on telecom/banking customer data
- Built models using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost (final chosen model)
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall
- Churn probability predictions
- Power BI dashboard for visual insights
- **Interactive Streamlit app** for model demo

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Streamlit (UI deployment)
- Power BI (visualization)
- Matplotlib (for churn drivers)
- Jupyter Notebook
